# CLEANED Testbench for Developing and Testing Deep Learning-algorithms on KV260 with HLS4ML

This is the CLEANED repository affiliated with an bachelor's thesis establishing a testbench for the ATLAS-group at HVL. 

The [original repository](https://github.com/lolbraa/HLS4ML_testbench_KV260) is meant for reproducing our results and findings, and have a comprehensive look at our methodology. 

On the other hand, this repository serves as a base for future research. Our notebooks and models are included for testing and inspiration.

## Motivation

The main purpose of the testbench is to facilitate future research in machine learning-algorithms targetting the ATLAS-detector. By utilising FPGAs, inference can run ultra fast with large throughput, enabling new cases for advanced algorithms on the edge. Though, FPGAs are notorious for its introduction threshold. Our work is mainly establishing a low-threshold solution for rapid iterating model-development with testing on-device. Additionaly, we've done research ourselves into different architectures and quantization techniques.

The workflow is based on [HLS4ML](https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/hls4ml) for the KV260-platform, i.e. using Vivado and Vitis v2025.2. To bridge the gap between HLS4MLs Vitis-backend and final deployment, we deployed the still-in-development Vitis Unified-backend.

[AMD Xilinx Kria KV260](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1089-kv260-starter-kit) is a Starter Kit based on the [K26-SOM](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ds987-k26-som/Overview) (System On Modules), featuring an adopted version of Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC (XCK26). It's geared towards Deep Learning-application with an accelerator IP and spesification making its price-to-performance pretty solid.


## Directory structure 

[`development/`](development/) is the directory where we developed and synthesised different machine learning models.

[`onboard-verification/`](onboard-verification/) is for testing onboard the FPGA by using PYNQ.

[`dockerbuild/`](dockerbuild/) contains resources to build and run a docker image with the required software for a runing start. The software (Vivado/Vitis) is required to synthesize the models with HLS4ML.


## Notes

The work in this project has only been done in Linux environment, native, in a VM/container, or through WSL. 

Some jargon/glossaries we keep using throughout the project:
- VU is Vitis Unified, the HLS4ML backend that leveragin Vitis' system design flow to easily create a complete bitfile.
- Bitfile is what programs the logic blocks on the FPGA.
- DA stands for [Distributed Arithmetic](https://fastmachinelearning.org/hls4ml/advanced/da.html), an implementation of optimized operations in layers.
- [HGQ/HGQ2](https://calad0i.github.io/HGQ2/) (we use both interchangebly for HGQ2) is an quantization technique under training, yielding really good performance 
- Jet Tagging/jettag is a classification problem from CERN, often used as a benchmark in affiliated research
- Pixel Cluster Splitting/pixsplit is another, more niche problem which we've researched to diversify our effort.
